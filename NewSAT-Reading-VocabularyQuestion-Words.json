Aristotle identified happiness with ethics and with work, unlike Thomas Jefferson, who defined happiness as \"Indolence of Body; Tranquility of Mind,\" and thus what I  call creature comforts.

There are animal versions, if not equivalents, of Mozart, and they cannot make their spontaneous  <u>passions</u> into sustained happiness without education, any more than Mozart could have. Aristotle identified happiness with ethics and with work, unlike Thomas Jefferson, who defined happiness as \"Indolence of Body; Tranquility of Mind,\" and thus what I  call creature comforts. Aristotle also excluded as unethical anything that animals and artists do, for reasons that look wholly benighted to me. "
